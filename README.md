# okhttpExample

A one screen demo app that uses the OKHttp library (http://square.github.io/okhttp/) to handle Restful API calls. To demonstrate this, the app makes a call to the tfl api https://api.tfl.gov.uk/line/mode/tube/status to get the status of all the tube lines in london. The returned status of each tube line is then parsed and displayed in a very simple Recycler View.
